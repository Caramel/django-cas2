= Release Notes =

== Version 2.0.3-KTH-11 ==

  * Incorporated support for single sign out. 
  * Project has since then moved to other repository and all pull requests 
    seem to be thrown away, so the project seems officially a dead end 
    for other purposes than the ones intended by the maintainer.

== Version 2.0.3-KTH-10 ==
 
  * Added support for CAS proxy authentication.

== Version 2.0.3 ==

  * Added `CAS_EXTRA_LOGIN_PARAMS` setting (patched contributed by frasern).
  * Fixed behavior of `django_cas.decorators`: they now only return 403s for
    authenticated users.
  * Added `CAS_RETRY_LOGIN` settings (patch contributed by fahhem2).

== Version 2.0.2 ==

  * Added support for Django 1.0.

== Version 2.0.1 ==

  * Fixed normal redirects incorrectly being caught by `@user_passes_test`
    and `@permission_required`.
