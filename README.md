django-cas2
===========

CAS 2.0 authentication module for Django with support for proxy authentication
and single sign out. This project is a fork and rewrite of the original django-cas
module which is found at https://bitbucket.org/cpcc/django-cas/ as of this writing.
It is a drop-in replacement for most cases, but support for old versions of Python
and Django is removed and in the case you need this (you really shouldn't) you
have to look for the django-cas version mentioned above. 

[CAS](http://www.jasig.org/cas), Central Authentication Server, is an open source, 
single sign on solution for web applications. [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
is a Python web application framework.  

More useful detailed information about CAS is the [protocol specification](http://www.jasig.org/cas/protocol)
and the [CAS Proxy Walkthrough](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Proxy+CAS+Walkthrough)

## Installation

Run python setup.py install as per usual or mess with your PYTHONPATH appropriately.

### Django configuration

Add the django_cas CASMiddleware and CASBackends to the Django configuration. Note
that you need the Django AuthenticationMiddleware as well.

```
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
	...
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django_cas.middleware.CASMiddleware',
    ...
)

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
	...
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'django_cas.backends.CASBackend',
    ...
)
```

The login and logout URLs must be handled in the urls.py file, and to use proxy authentication
support also the proxy call back URL, see optional settings below.

```
...
(r'^accounts/login/$', 'django_cas.views.login'),
(r'^accounts/logout/$', 'django_cas.views.logout'),
...
```


### Configuration options for django-cas2

#### Mandatory setting

`CAS_SERVER_URL: None`,

Mandatory. The URL for the CAS server.

#### Optional settings

`CAS_EXTRA_LOGIN_PARAMS: None`

> Not quite sure what the purpose for this is, anyone using it? 
> /Fredrik JÃ¶nsson Oct 15 2012

A dictionary of extra URL parameters to add to the login URL when redirecting the user.

`CAS_RENEW: False`

If `True`, enables the renew feature of CAS, sending renew parameter on login
and verification of tickets to enforce that the login is made with a fresh
username and password verification in the CAS server.

`CAS_LOGOUT_COMPLETELY: True`

If `True`, redirect and do a CAS logout when user logs out of the Django application.
It is in most cases pointless to turn this off unless CAS_RENEW is set. 

`CAS_SINGLE_SIGN_OUT: True`

If `True`, support single sign out reqeusts form the CAS server and sign out of the
Django application when a user signs out of CAS.

`CAS_REDIRECT_URL: '/'`

Default URL to redirect to after login and logout when there is no referrer or next
page provided by Django.

`CAS_IGNORE_REFERER: False`

If `True`, logging out of the application will always send the user to the URL specified by `CAS_REDIRECT_URL`.

`CAS_RETRY_LOGIN: False`

If `True`, redirect back to CAS server if CAS authentication fails.

`CAS_PROXY_CALLBACK: None`

The callback URL the CAS server should use to inject proxy tickets. Setting this enables
proxy granting ticket support. The URL must also be registered in urls.py and handled
by the django_cas.views.proxy_callback, e.g:
`(r'^accounts/login/casProxyCallback$', 'django_cas.views.proxy_callback')`
See [Proxy CAS Authentication](https://github.com/fjollberg/django-cas2/PROXY_AUTHENTICATION.md)
for more information and trouble shooting hints.
	
`CAS_LOGOUT_REQUEST_ALLOWED: ()`

TODO: DROP THIS AND ONLY ALLOW SERVER IN CAS_SERVER_URL TO LOGOUT, OR REMOVE COMPLETELY.

`CAS_AUTO_CREATE_USERS : False`

If `True`, automatically create accounts for authenticated users which don't have one. This
is a change in behavior from the original django-cas module which hade no such option and
auto created users.

`CAS_ALLOWED_PROXIES : []`

A list of URLs of proxies that are allowed to proxy authenticate to the Django application.
If set, the proxy chain provided by the CAS server in the validation response must not contain
services that are not included in this list. There is currently no wild carding or other magic.

to or by you if you use it.

## Rationale for forking

The django-cas project has been rather poorly maintained for some time. The most obviuos changes
include moving the repo around. Patches supplied by myself in order to support proxy authentication
and by others for single sign out (http://code.google.com/r/arnaudgrausem-django-cas/) have 
not been integrated but are in fact lost in the repo changes.

Also the django_cas project suffers from dead code, some wierdness and support for really, 
really old versions of CAS, Python and Django, bogging it down.

The module is still called django_cas for the time being, the rationale being that it is
a drop-in replacement and I don't want to handle the migrations issues in the database for now.
